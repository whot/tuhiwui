tuhi-wui
========

Tuhi is a DBus session daemon that connects to and fetches the data from the
Wacom ink range (Spark, Slate, Folio, Intuos Paper, ...). See
https://github.com/tuhiproject/tuhi for more information.

tuhi-wui is a graphical user interface to access Tuhi and allow users to
register devices and download drawings from those devices.

tuhi-wui uses electron and React.

Note: this is very much a "my first web app", any feedback will be
appreciated.
